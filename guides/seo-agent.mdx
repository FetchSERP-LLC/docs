## Setup in 2 minutes

1. **Get an API token** from your [fetchSERP dashboard](https://www.fetchserp.com)
2. **Add the MCP server configuration** to Claude Desktop:

```json title="~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json"
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fetchserp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "github:fetchSERP/fetchserp-mcp-server-node"
      ],
      "env": {
        "FETCHSERP_API_TOKEN": "YOUR_FETCHSERP_API_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Restart Claude Desktop** and start chatting! âœ¨

## What can I ask?

```prompt
What are the top keywords my competitor "example.com" is ranking for?
```

```prompt
Analyze the backlinks for the domain "fetchserp.com" and suggest improvements.
```

```prompt
Find long-tail keywords with low competition related to "email marketing".
```

## How it works

The MCP server exposes all fetchSERP endpoints as tools inside the chat. When you ask a question, Claude chooses the right endpoint, fetches real-time data, and responds with actionable insights.
