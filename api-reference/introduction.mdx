Welcome to the **fetchSERP API** documentation. All reference pages you see in this section are auto-generated from our [openapi.json](/openapi.json) specification, so they're always in sync with the latest version of the API.

## Authentication

Every request must include your API token in the `Authorization` header as a **Bearer** token:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

• Tokens are created in the [dashboard](https://www.fetchserp.com/app).  
• If a request is sent without a token or with an invalid token, the API responds with **401 Unauthorized**.

## Rate Limits

We allow up to **600 requests per minute** per account (aggregated across all endpoints). When the limit is exceeded the API responds with **429 Too Many Requests** plus a `Retry-After` header indicating how many seconds to wait before retrying.

If you need higher throughput, please [contact support](mailto:support@fetchserp.com) and we'll bump the limit for your workspace.
